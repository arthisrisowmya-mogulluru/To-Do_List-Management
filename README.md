# To-Do_List

The code implements a to-do list application using classes in Python. The `Task` class represents a task with attributes like title, description, and status. The `ToDoList` class manages a list of tasks and provides methods to add a task, delete a task, view tasks, save tasks to a file and load tasks from a file. The `main` function acts as the entry point of the program and presents a menu to the user to interact with the application.
